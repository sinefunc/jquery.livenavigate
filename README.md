Livenavigate
============

#### In-page navigation that doesn't break the back button and actually changes the URL.

What it solves
--------------

The usual approach to single-page apps are URL's like
`http://domain.com/#!1938/article`. Livenavigate does the same thing,
except that it your URL will be `http://domain.com/1938/article`, yet
everything will be in-place via AJAX.

This is only supported if your browser supports history states (FF4/Safari).
Don't worry though--it will fallback to the hashbang method otherwise.

For hashbang URL's, this relies on the awesome jQuery.hashListen. It
uses the hash change event, and falls back to window timers if it's not
available.

End result: in-place navigation with nice URL's, no matter what browser.

Usage
-----

    /* Bind this to like, say, <a> links */
    $.navigate('/admin/products');

If the history states are available (Safari/FF4), it will change the actual URL
of the page, yet still /not/ load the URL directly (but instead just trigger the
`navigate` event).

    /* Here's how you listen to new pages */
    $(window).bind('navigate', function (e, href) {
      /* href == '/admin/products' */
    });

If history states are not available, it will fall back to hashListen.

Common example
--------------

In your HTML, include both JS files. (jQuery 1.3+ required)

    <script src="jquery.js">
    <script src="jquery.hashlisten.js">
    <script src="jquery.livenavigate.js">

Now you probably have links like this:

    <a href="/product/12">Fish steamer</a>

In your JS, let's bind all `<a>` links to open in-place.

    $("a").live('click', function() {
        // Ignore <a rel='external'>
        if ($(this).is("[rel~=external]")) { return true; }

        // Navigate to it.
        var href = $(this).attr('href');
        $.navigate(href);

        // Show a loading spinner or something.
        $("#loading").show();
        return false;
    });

Now let's hook it up to load the URL's via AJAX.

    $window.bind('navigate', function (e, href) {
        // Load it via AJAX.
        $.get(href, function(data)
        {
            // Pick out the content from it.
            var $data = $("<div>").html(data);
            var html  = $data.find('#content').html();

            // Load it in place.
            $("#content").html(html);

            // Hide the spinner
            $("#loading").hide();
        });
    });
